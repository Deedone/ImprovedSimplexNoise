# ImprovedSimplexNoise
Arduino Library for SimplexNoise
This is an improved version of [this library](https://github.com/jshaw/SimplexNoise).
Improvements consist mainly of decreasing the memory footprint and allowance of true randomization.
You can choose reduced memory or randomization by toggling defines in the lib's header file.
